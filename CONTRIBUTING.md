# Contributing to mini

First off, thank you for considering contributing to mini! Itâ€™s people like you that make open source projects like this thrive.

## Where to Start

mini is an experimental project, and there are many ways to contribute. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, your input is valuable. Here are a few areas where you can help:

### 1. Enhancing the Agent's Core Logic

The core of the agent lives in the `coding_agent/` directory. You can contribute by:
- Improving the planning and execution phases of the agent.
- Enhancing the self-reflection capabilities to generate more insightful logs.
- Optimizing the agent's interaction with the LLM.

### 2. Refining the Self-Learning Mechanism

The self-learning and self-evolving aspects are what make mini unique. You can contribute by:
- Improving the `self_learning_api.py` to handle more complex scenarios.
- Enhancing the logic that analyzes reflection logs and proposes self-edits.
- Exploring new ways for the agent to learn and evolve.

### 3. Expanding the Agent's Toolset

The agent's capabilities can be extended by giving it more tools to work with. You can contribute by:
- Integrating new tools for code analysis, such as linters or static analysis tools.
- Adding new capabilities, like the ability to interact with different APIs or services.
- Improving the existing Playwright integration for browser automation.

### 4. Improving the Prompts

The quality of the prompts used to interact with the LLM is crucial for the agent's performance. You can contribute by:
- Refining the existing prompts in the `coding_agent/` directory to be more effective.
- Creating new prompts for different tasks or scenarios.
- Experimenting with different prompting techniques to improve the agent's reasoning.

### 5. Strengthening the Testing Suite

Given that mini modifies its own code, a robust testing suite is essential. You can contribute by:
- Adding new unit tests for the agent's core logic in the `tests/` directory.
- Creating more complex scenarios in the `tests/dummy project/` to test the agent's capabilities.
- Adding integration tests to ensure that the different parts of the system work well together.

### 6. Improving the Documentation

Good documentation makes it easier for everyone to use and contribute to the project. You can contribute by:
- Improving the `README.md` file with more details or clearer explanations.
- Adding more examples of how to use the agent.
- Documenting the code with comments to make it easier to understand.
